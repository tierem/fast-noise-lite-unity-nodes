## How to use

Download the latest release and drag and drop the file inside your unity project to import it. Alternatively, right click on the asset browser and select "Import Package -> Custom Package...".
After importing, all the noise nodes will be accessible in shader graph along with some example shaders.

## Raymarcher

You can also find a basic raymarching shader written in HLSL that uses the library's 3D noise function. This has to be adapted and only serves as an example.
